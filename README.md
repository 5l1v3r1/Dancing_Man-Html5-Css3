Animation in Pure CSS3 and HTML5

<p>For this animation I started from this project:
https://codepen.io/poziomq/pen/NbjZpG</p>

<p>The code is (fairly) responsive and fits discretely well with every type of screen and device.<p>


<h3>Browser Compatibility:</h3>
<p>Chrome, Opera, Mozilla.</p>

<p>As usual Internet Explorer interprets the code in html5 very badly.</p>

<p>In Safari, however, the 'audio player is not displayed and the background made of gradients is not read well (giving a background on red)</p>
