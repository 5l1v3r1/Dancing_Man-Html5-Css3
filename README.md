<p>For this animation I started from this project:
https://codepen.io/poziomq/pen/NbjZpG</p>

<p>The code is (fairly) responsive and fits very well with every type of screen and device.<p>

<h3>Browser Compatibility:</h3>
<p>Chrome, Opera, Mozilla.</p>

<p>Incredibly even Internet Explorer can read the code without any problem....</BR> (some say there is a hand of the reptilians).</p>
